  While is the todo list for<br>
  highly organized list-lovers.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine an outline.<br>
  Now, imagine a todo list.<br>
  While is both.

  Let’s say you’re traveling to Europe&hellip;
</p>

<p>
  Start with a big task like “Visit Europe.”<br>
  Then break it down into smaller tasks.<br>
  Add things like “Pack” and “Buy tickets.”<br>
  Then add “Camera” under “Pack,”<br>
  and “Batteries” under “Camera.”<br>
  Nest items to your heart’s content.
</p>

<p>
  While is fun, fast, and free.

    My name is Avand and I’m building While because I love outlines and I love
    todo lists. In school, my notes became the most incredibly detailed
    outlines. I love making lists and crossing off todos. I’ve tried out a lot
    of todo list apps but couldn’t find anything that worked exactly how I
    wanted. So, in an exercise of extreme obsession to detail, I decided to
    build While to “scratch my own itch.”
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, grouping todos is just as important as the todo itself. So I decided
    give them equal importance. In While, a todo is not just a “check-off-able”
    task but is also a folder for other tasks. One task can very easily be
    broken into smaller ones. And you can jump around quickly and move stuff
    around as you’d expect.
  <p>

  <p>
    I love todo lists and this is my favorite one.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you enjoy it too,<br>
